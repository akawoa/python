# Basic - Print all integers from 0 to 150.

# for x in range(0, 151, 1):
#     print (x)

# Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000

# for x in range(5, 1005, 5):
#     print (x)

# Counting, the Dojo Way - Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If divisible by 10, print "Coding Dojo".

# y = 0
# while y < 100:
#     y = y + 1
#     if y % 10 == 0:
#         print("Coding Dojo")
#     elif y % 5 == 0:
#         print("Coding")
#     else:
#         print(y)


# Whoa. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500, 000, and print the final sum.

# z = 0
# y = 0
# while y < 500000:
#     y = y + 1
#     if ((y % 1 != 0) and (y % 3 != 0)):
#         y = y + 1
#         y = y + 1
#     elif ((y % 1 == 0) or (y % 3 == 0)):
#         z + y
#         y = y + 1
#     elif y == 500000:
#         print(z)


# Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.

# y = 2018
# while y > 0:
#     print(y)
#     y = y - 4
#     if y == 0:
#         break
# else:
#     print("Final else statement")


# Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum = 2, highNum = 9, and mult = 3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)
